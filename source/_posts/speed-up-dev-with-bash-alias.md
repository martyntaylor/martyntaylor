excerpt: Introduction to my long overdue blog.

So here it is.

After years of procrastination, I have finally launched my site.   

It's not how I imagined it would look. 

I have developed this site many, many times. I just never published it as I would always end up unhappy with the outcome. Not that these sites were bad, it was more me chasing my version of perfection that I could never manage.

This form of perfection procrastination has hindered me not only in my quest to get this site produced, but in many aspects of my life (even now as I write, and rewrite this post).

As this is something I want to improve on, I had a reminder earlier today when my manager at Car & Classic posted this tweet in our Slack channel -

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“First do it, then do it right, then do it better.”<br>― Addy Osmani</p>&mdash; Amir Salihefendić (@amix3k) <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k/status/1359774458244866050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

What if I just get something up? 

After all this is what I do in my job. We work to produce an MVP, then iterate over making improvements, so why am I not following this for my own site?

With renewed motivation, I decided on a static site generator - [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/){rel=nofollow target=blank} from Tighten which is aimed at Laravel developers.

With the aim to getting something up, I tried not to be precious about the design.  In fact, it is a stripped down version of their starter theme, with just a different font and default colour.

Sure it's not the _best_ looking site, but I  will improve upon this (along with my writing!), but for now its up and out there for the world to see.

I hope you enjoy :)
